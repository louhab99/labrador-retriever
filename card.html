			<p class="description">The Labrador is classified as a sporting breed, but is best known as a companion and working dog. Its beginnings are from the island of Newfoundland where it was used to retrieve and pull fishing nets out of the water for fishermen. When introduced to England in the 1800's its retrieving instincts were further refined. Today this multi-talented dog is often used as a service dog and is sometimes employed by the police as a drug-sniffing dog.</p>
